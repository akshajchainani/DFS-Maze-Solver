# Depth-First Search (DFS) in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm using the `pyamaze` library. The DFS algorithm is used to explore and solve mazes, and the project includes both basic and advanced demonstrations with visualization.

## Files in the Repository



### 1. `DFSfinal.py`
- **Description**: Advanced implementation of the DFS algorithm.
- **Features**:
  - Supports multiple agents with different visual attributes.
  - Displays intermediate exploration steps.
  - Allows goal customization.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  python DFSfinal.py
  ```

### 2. `dfs.csv`
- **Description**: Contains sample data related to DFS (optional for use).

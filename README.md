# Depth-First Search (DFS) Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains Python implementations of the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm using the `pyamaze` library. The DFS algorithm is used to navigate and find paths in a maze.

## Contents
- **DFS.py**: Basic DFS implementation for solving a maze.
- **DFSDemo.py**: Advanced DFS demonstration with visualization and multiple agents.
- **dfs.csv**: Sample data related to DFS (details may vary).

## Features
- üß© **Maze Creation**: Generate customizable mazes.
- üó∫Ô∏è **Pathfinding**: Solve the maze using DFS.
- ‚ú® **Visualization**: Visualize paths with agents in the maze.

## Requirements
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x
- **Dependencies**:
  - `pyamaze`

### Installation
To install the required library, run:
```bash
pip install pyamaze

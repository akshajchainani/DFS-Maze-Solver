# Depth-First Search (DFS) in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm using the `pyamaze` library. The DFS algorithm is used to explore and solve mazes, and the project includes both basic and advanced demonstrations with visualization.

## Files in the Repository

### 1. `DFS.py`
- **Description**: Implements the DFS algorithm for maze solving.
- **Features**:
  - Generates a maze of customizable size.
  - Finds a path from the start to the goal.
  - Visualizes the solved path.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  python DFS.py
  ```

### 2. `DFSDemo.py`
- **Description**: Advanced implementation of the DFS algorithm.
- **Features**:
  - Supports multiple agents with different visual attributes.
  - Displays intermediate exploration steps.
  - Allows goal customization.
- **How to Run**:
  ```bash
  python DFSDemo.py
  ```

### 3. `dfs.csv`
- **Description**: Contains sample data related to DFS (optional for use).

- **Pathfinding**: Efficiently solve mazes using DFS.
- **Visualization**: Interactive visual representation of maze exploration.

---

## Requirements
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x
- **Dependencies**:
  - `pyamaze`

Install the required library using:
```bash
pip install pyamaze
```

## Usage

### Run Basic DFS Example:
1. Navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
2. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python DFS.py
   ```

### Run Advanced DFS Demonstration:
1. Navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
2. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python DFSDemo.py
   ```

## Example Output

### Basic DFS (`DFS.py`):
Generates a maze and visualizes the shortest path to the goal using a single agent.

### Advanced DFS (`DFSDemo.py`):
Demonstrates DFS with:
- Multiple agents with different visual appearances.
- Visualization of explored cells and final paths.
